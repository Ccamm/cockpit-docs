## Introduction

*Locales* define the languages you want to use in your content. Define and use locals whenever you want to provide content in different translations.

## Managing locales

You can set up localization as described in the following steps:

1. Login to your Cockpit installation at [https://cockpit.example.com](https://cockpit.example.com)
2. Navigate to *Settings > Locales* at [https://cockpit.example.com/system/locales](https://cockpit.example.com/system/locales)
3. See the list of locales, that have already been created
4. Add new locales or modify existing locales
