## Why Cockpit?

Why Cockpit? Good question - let it be answered by a few key facts:

* The first version of Cockpit was released back in October 2013 - [Agentejo](https://github.com/agentejo) as well as the Cockpit [Community](https://github.com/Cockpit-HQ/cockpit-next/graphs/contributors) made major improvements since then.
* Cockpit is 100% open source - you can contribute, copy code or modify Cockpit to suit your own needs at any time. See [Github](https://github.com/Cockpit-HQ/cockpit-next).
* Cockpit is built as a stand-alone solution without major dependencies. See [Github](https://github.com/Cockpit-HQ/cockpit-next).
* Cockpit is self-hosted, which means that anything you need is a webserver running PHP. See [Installation](/about/installation).

## Comparing Cockpit to other headless CMS solutions

As you probably know, there's a lot of *headless CMS* solutions out in the web. In case Cockpit did not suit your needs we listed a couple of them in the following lines. Feel free to have a look at them:

* [Apigility CMS](https://agilitycms.com/)
* [Butter CMS](https://buttercms.com/)
* [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/)
* [Contentstack](https://www.contentstack.com/)
* [Coredna](https://www.coredna.com/)
* [Dato CMS](https://www.datocms.com/)
* [Directus](https://directus.io/)
* [Dot CMS](https://dotcms.com/)
* [Flextype](https://flextype.org/)
* [Graph CMS](https://graphcms.com/)
* [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
* [Prismic CMS](https://prismic.io/)
* [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
* [Sitecore](https://www.sitecore.com/)
* [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)

Although their functions are the same to a great extent and some also surpass Cockpit regarding features and functions, we still believe in Cockpit's advantages.

### Use Cockpit for free

Cockpit is free of charge for everyone. Just install and start using it. Head over to this documentation's [Quickstart](/quickstart/) section as a good starting point.  

### Decide where you store your data

In contrast to headless solutions provided as SaaS (Software as a service) Cockpit is self-hosted. With a self-hosted application running on your webserver of choice you have full control over the data and content stored in Cockpit.

This allows you to run Cockpit i.e.

* on a hosting provider you trust
* on a web server of your own
* in an intranet

### Extend and modify Cockpit

As Cockpit is a 100% open-source application (see [Github](https://github.com/Cockpit-HQ/cockpit-next)) you can modify and extend it if you need or wish to.
