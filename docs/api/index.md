# API

::: tip Important notes
This is the API section of the Cockpit documentation. Note, that we use [https://cockpit.example.com](https://cockpit.example.com) as domain in our examples, which has to be replaced by your domain in all code snippets or links below.

Cockpit itself provides a very useful API playground at [https://cockpit.example.com/system/api](https://cockpit.example.com/system/api) you can use at any time to investigate the API and your data in the admin panel. Try it!
