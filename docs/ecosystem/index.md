This section of the documentation is meant to provide a section of third party tools and libraries, that integrate well with [Cockpit](/). This can be tools for development, API client libraries, CMS systems, that connect to Cockpit, as well as any non-technical tools or resources.

You made one yourself? You found a resource, that work's well with Cockpit? Fell free to get in touch with us or make a pull request at any time via [Github](https://github.com/Cockpit-HQ/docs).
