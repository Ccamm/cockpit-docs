## Introduction

You ask yourself what assets are? Some of the most important assets on most websites are images and documents.

## How to manage assets

Cockpit provides you with a couple of out-of-the box features, that make managing assets pretty straightforward:

* Search existing assets
* Organize assets in folders
* Upload new assets from
  * your local hard disk (your device if on a smartphone)
  * from your device's camera
  * a screencast (video)

## Asset details

As soon as an asset was uploaded you can edit title and description as well as assign tags. Moreover, you can replace the file of your asset, which allows updating i.e. a product sheet with a new version with all references to the asset remaining valid.
