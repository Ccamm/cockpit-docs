# Pages

[[toc]]


Pages is a Cockpit addon, which takes a page-centric approach to content creation and editing.

## Managing pages

### The list of pages

Note, that pages can be organized in a menu like way by dragging and dropping a page as a child of other pages.

### Create or edit a page

Each *Page* contains some common fields, such as a title, a slug and the SEO part. All additional content is organized in a Layout. Use the layout to create highly flexible and customized content foreach of your pages.

## Menus

While pages themselves are standalone pieces of data they are usually organized within one or more menus. Whenever you require a menu i.e. in the header or footer of a website, Cockpit's *Menus* feature can be used to organize your pages.
